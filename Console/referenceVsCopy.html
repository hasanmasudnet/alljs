            let age2 = age;
            console.log('age: ', age, 'age2: ', age2);

            age = 200;
            console.log('age: ', age, 'age2: ', age2);

            let name2 = name;
            console.log(name, name2);

            name = 'dude';
            console.log(name, name2);

            // so the variables don't change the other one, only the originals

            // Let's say we have an array
            const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

            // and we want to make a copy of it.
            const team = players;

            console.log(players, team);

            // You might think we can just do something like this:
            team[3] = 'Lux';
            console.log(players, team);
            // an example of reference, team is the reference of players

            // however what happens when we update that array?

            // now here is the problem!

            // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

            // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

            // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

            // one way

            // or create a new array and concat the old one in

            // or use the new ES6 Spread
            // this is more suitable
            const team2 = [...players];
            console.log(team2);
            // it's not reference , it's a new array

            // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

            // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

            // and think we make a copy:
            //const captain = person;
            //captain.number = 99;
            // this is a reference

            // how do we take a copy instead?
